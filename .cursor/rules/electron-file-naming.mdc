# Electron File Naming Conventions

## File Extensions
- `.cjs` - CommonJS modules (for Electron main process files)
- `.js/.ts/.tsx` - ES modules (for React/Vite code)

## Why This Matters
Node.js treats files differently based on extension and the `"type"` field in `package.json`:

1. When `"type": "module"` is set in `package.json`:
   - `.js` files are treated as ES modules (can use `import`/`export`)
   - `.cjs` files are treated as CommonJS modules (can use `require`/`module.exports`)

2. Electron's main process works best with CommonJS:
   - Main process files should use `.cjs` extension
   - Preload scripts should use `.cjs` extension

## Examples
- ✅ `electron/main.cjs` - Correct for Electron main process
- ✅ `electron/preload.cjs` - Correct for Electron preload script
- ❌ `electron/main.js` - Will cause errors with `require()` and `__dirname`

## Converting JS to CJS
When converting a `.js` file to `.cjs`:
1. Rename the file extension
2. Use `require()` instead of `import`
3. Use `module.exports` instead of `export`
4. Keep using `__dirname` and `__filename` as needed
